Space Heater is a second edition of the yet unfinished Air Conditioning. 
as Air Conditioning is quickly becoming unmanagably complex, Space heater is intended to implement the same algorithim but in a less efficient but
more concise manner.

So its going to run like shit, but the code might make some sense, and work.

Plot twist: I'm not going to build this.
at least not yet.
