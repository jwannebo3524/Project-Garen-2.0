#Project Garen 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------
if anyone has a better name please share.

League of Legends bot development.

As of now the only stuff is from the LAG bot, which is so dumb it is incapable of playing the game. just for reference and mabye a bit of copy and paste. WE SHOULD NOT USE A LAG-TYPE ARCHITECTURE. IT IS A BAD DESIGN.

#contribuiting to the repository

Feel free to use main, but if you feel like something needs a new branch you can do that too.

Make sure your code has some comments (like headers for classes and functions), and if it needs explanation give it explanation.
If you are auto-generating a ton of data files put them in their own folder.

Later we can have a folder for tests (graphs, testing data, trained bots (if applicable) or parts of bots, training data, ect...) Don't put stuff like that in main (unless/until we train a single main version of the bot that has passed testing.)
